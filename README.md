KvantSwarm
==========

KvantSwam is a custom renderer for Unity, which was initially made as a GPU
accelerated swarm behavior simulation.

Though the initial goal was not met, I noticed that its organic and chaotic
behavior can be used to make a beautiful eye-candy.

System Requirements
-------------------

Unity 5.1 or later versions.

Compatibility
-------------

KvantSwarm needs a 4-component floating-point texture format. Basically, it
means it runs only on desktop/laptop-class GPUs.
